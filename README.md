# GenAI stories 

This project leverages the power of web scraping, generative AI, automated editing, and Python scripting to transform scraped short stories into engaging scripts, along with accompanying visuals. The key components include:

Short Story Scraping: Collecting a rich dataset of short stories from online sources.
Generative AI Integration: Using ChatGPT and similar AI models to generate compelling scripts and creative image representations from the scraped narratives.
Automated Editing: Implementing techniques to streamline editing, ensuring coherence and quality in the generated outputs.
Publication: Developing a process for publishing the final scripts and images (formats, platforms to be determined).
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
A ChatGPT API key (obtain from OpenAI)
Additional libraries (will be listed as the project develops)
Installation:
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/short-story-generator.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd short-story-generator
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Timeline
Phase 1: Short Story Scraping

Tasks
Identify target websites for short story scraping.
Develop web scraping scripts (consider ethical implications).
Create a structured data storage solution (e.g., database or structured text files).
Phase 2: Generative AI Integration

Tasks
Research and experiment with suitable generative AI models (ChatGPT, others).
Set up API access.
Develop prompts and workflows for interacting with the AI models for script and image creation.
Phase 3: Automated Editing

Tasks
Define editing goals (grammar, style, plot inconsistencies, etc.).
Explore natural language processing tools and techniques for automated editing.
Phase 4: Publication

Tasks
Determine potential publication formats (e.g., screenplay PDFs, webcomics, videos).
Research and select platforms for publication.
Implement an automated or semi-automated publication process.
